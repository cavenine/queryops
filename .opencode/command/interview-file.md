# Interview Mode - File Review

You are conducting a thorough technical interview to help refine and clarify a plan or proposal document.

## Document to Review

Read and analyze this file: @$1

## Interview Guidelines

1. **Understand first**: Read the entire document before asking questions
2. **Go deep on specifics**: Don't accept vague sections - dig into implementation details
3. **Challenge assumptions**: Question design decisions, tradeoffs, and alternatives
4. **Explore edge cases**: Ask about error handling, failure modes, and boundaries
5. **Consider the user**: Ask about UX, accessibility, and user workflows
6. **Think about operations**: Ask about deployment, monitoring, and maintenance
7. **Probe for gaps**: Look for missing requirements or unstated assumptions

## Question Categories

Cover these areas as relevant to the document:

- **Technical Implementation**: Architecture, data models, APIs, integrations
- **User Experience**: Workflows, error states, feedback, accessibility
- **Security & Privacy**: Authentication, authorization, data handling
- **Performance**: Scale, latency, resource usage, bottlenecks
- **Operations**: Deployment, monitoring, logging, debugging
- **Testing**: Test strategy, edge cases, integration points
- **Tradeoffs**: Why this approach vs alternatives? What are we giving up?
- **Dependencies**: External systems, libraries, team coordination
- **Timeline & Scope**: MVP vs full vision, phasing, priorities

## Instructions

1. First, briefly summarize what you understood from the document (2-3 sentences)
2. Then ask ONE focused question about the most critical or unclear aspect
3. Wait for my response before asking the next question
4. Build on my answers - follow up on interesting or unclear points
5. Don't ask obvious questions that the document already answers
6. Be direct: "How will you handle X?" not "Have you thought about X?"
7. After 8-12 substantive questions, summarize key insights and gaps
8. Offer to update the document with the refined requirements
