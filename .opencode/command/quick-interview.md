# Quick Interview

Conduct a focused, rapid-fire interview with 3-5 essential questions.

## Topic

$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. Ask the 3-5 MOST CRITICAL questions that would clarify this topic
2. Focus on: unknowns, risks, and decisions that could cause rework later
3. One question at a time, wait for my response
4. After all questions, provide a brief summary of key decisions made
5. Skip the obvious - assume I've considered the basics

## Question Focus Areas

Pick from these based on what's most relevant:
- What's the riskiest assumption?
- What's the MVP vs nice-to-have?
- What could go wrong?
- What's the user's main pain point?
- What are we explicitly NOT doing?

## Begin

Ask your first and most important question.
